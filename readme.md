# remark-range

Deprecated. `offset`s are now built into remark (`remark@>=4.0.0`),
and the `toOffset` and `toPosition` methods are now available through
[`vfile-location`](https://github.com/wooorm/vfile-location).

[Previous versions of `remark-range` can still be used](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-range/tree/a7004864fa9cc6353357e754c53cf722914e0a28).
